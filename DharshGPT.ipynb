      "    2. Weight and Fuel: The minimum weight of a car is 730 kg (with the driver), and a maximum of 102 kg of fuel can be used during a race.\n",
      "\n",
      "    3. Engine Regulations: Each team is allowed to use a certain number of engines and engine components throughout the season. In recent years, teams have been limited to using 3 power unit elements per season.\n",

      "    4. Tire Rules: Teams must use the same type of tires for the entire race weekend (qualifying and races). However, they can choose which compound (soft, medium or hard) to use. Since 2018, teams are allowed to use up to 11 sets of tires during the course of a weekend, with some limitations on the number of new sets that can be used in qualifying and races.\n",
